There are two folders, which include Matlab codes for the study of listric fault structure inversion.

    Code_for_Manuscripts- All codes for evaluating synthetic and real listric fault structures inversion used in the manuscript.

    Listric_Fault_Invert_GUI- All codes for the GUI for estimating any listric fault structures.
